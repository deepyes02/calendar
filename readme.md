# JavaScript Calendar with Multi Events #
This is a simple Javascript library that can be implemented into any projects. The calendar properly shows months, days and dates, and also is able to select multiple days for a specific event. I think this will be useful for many developers who want to have this functionality, since many libraries save this as a premium option.

## Work in progress ##
This is a work in progress and is not complete. I'm looking forward to complete this and also provide documentation so that people can make use of this.


## Usefulness ##
This program can be useful for companies that have sell events on different dates, for example, a trip that happens on custom date, and additional information as required, so that such dates can be displayed on the frontend.
