# JavaScript Calendar with Multi Events Selector #
This is a simple Javascript application that shows months, days and dates, and also is able to select multiple days for a specific event. I think this will be useful for many developers who want to have this functionality, since many libraries save this as a premium option.

## The Problem in Travel Industry ##
I am trying to solve the problem of date related application in the web, essentially a dynamic environment where it's easy to pick up dates of event sales.
Mostly, trips come with an option to put up sales in various dates, mostly during busy season.

The enterpreneur knows when the bookings should open, but doesn't have a tool to display that on his website without some heavy developer hiring. The short term solutions are simply hardcoding dates, or buying enormous software that comes with unwanted functionalities, or technicalities.

This application will solve this problem, by enabling the enterpreneur to simply pick up dates for upcoming **Fixed Departure** dates, and them will render nicely on the pages where such dates are picked on the front-end. 

1. A predesigned UI will render such events if they exist, and hence provide a useful functionality to the business.

2. Clients will be able to pick on the dates, see any more related information, and send the booking. 

3. This information will be saved in the database, available in the database and promply notified to the seller.

4. The sample application will be general purpose, and could be integrated into similar business. 


### Backend & Frontend Usage ###
- A calendar that allows selecting multiple dates on a page/post/event
- A List of available dates on the front-end render on that specific page

## Work in progress ##
This is a work in progress and is not complete. I'm looking forward to complete this and also provide documentation so that people can make use of this.


## Usefulness ##
This program can be useful for companies that have sell events on different dates, for example, a trip that happens on custom date, and additional information as required, so that such dates can be displayed on the frontend.
